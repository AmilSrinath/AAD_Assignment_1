<h1>In-Memory POS System API</h1>

<h3>Overview</h3>

This repository contains the Java EE implementation of a comprehensive API for the existing front-end In-Memory POS system. The API integrates various specifications, including Servlet, JSON, and JNDI, to provide basic CRUD operations, fundamental validations, appropriate design patterns, database integration with SQL through JNDI, a proper logging mechanism, and thorough API documentation.

<h3>Components</h3>

<h3>1. Basic CRUD Operations</h3>
The API supports Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations for managing POS system data.

<h3>2. Fundamental Validations</h3>
Robust validation mechanisms are implemented to ensure the integrity and correctness of the data processed by the API.

<h3>3. Design Patterns and Packaging</h3>
Thoughtful design patterns such as Singleton, Factory, or Observer are implemented to enhance the maintainability and scalability of the code. The project is organized with a well-thought-out packaging structure.

<h3>4. Database Integration with JNDI</h3>
The API seamlessly integrates with a SQL database using Java Naming and Directory Interface (JNDI) for efficient data storage and retrieval.

<h3>5. Logging Mechanism</h3>
A proper logging mechanism is in place to capture and store relevant information about the API's operations. This ensures effective monitoring and troubleshooting.

<h3>6. API Documentation</h3>
API documentation is provided to facilitate easy understanding and integration. Postman is used for detailed documentation, including request and response examples.

<h3>7. README and License File</h3>
A well-structured README file is included, providing essential information on how to set up, configure, and use the API. Additionally, a license file outlines the terms under which the software can be used, modified, and distributed.
